Project Overview:
This project is a fully functional e-commerce website developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The application provides a seamless user experience for browsing products, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing orders with payment integration. It is designed to be highly scalable, secure, and user-friendly.

   - The product listing can be filtered by categories, price range, and ratings.
   
2. User Authentication:
   - Secure user authentication and authorization implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
   
3. Shopping Cart:
   - Users can add products to their cart, modify quantities, and remove items.
   - The cart persists between sessions, ensuring users donâ€™t lose their progress.
